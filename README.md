## Installation

-> [Installation instruction](./INSTALLATION.md)

## Settings

### Wear

* Vibration: the watch vibrate if the target range is left and repeat it as long as the target range is left
* Colored AOD: some watchfaces only support colored complications for the always on display, if there is no monochrom one, then you have to activate this feature
* Big trend-arrow: for watches like Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro until Wear OS 3, the trend arrow is rendered too big, so you can disable this setting to have a smaller trend-arrow
* Foreground: recommended to prevent Wear OS from closing this app (also try deactivating Play Protect as this kills non Playstore apps)
* Relative time: shows the relative time in minutes since the last value was received instead of the timestamp of the last value. This may not work correct on some watches related to Android battery optimizations.
* other settings: all other settings are made in the phone app

### Phone

The settings for the phone are described in the app itself. The settings from the phone will be send to the wear, if it is connected.

## Sources

### LibreLink

To set up LibreLink as follower, you need the account data from LibreLinkUp.
If you have not set up your LibreLinkUp account yet, follow this [instruction](https://librelinkup.com/articles/getting-started).

Here is a quick summary of the steps to do:
* open your FreeStyle Libre App and select in the menu `Share` or `Connected Apps`
* activate LibreLinkUp connection
* install LibreLinkUp from [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.LibreLinkUp)
* setup your accout and wait for the invitation
* after accept the invitation you do not need the LibreLinkUp App "anymore"
* now you can add your LibreLinkUp account to GlucoDataHandler and activate this source

## Widgets
There are several types of widgets and a floating widget for the phone:

## Notifications
There are two notifciations which can be activated. For each notification the icon can be choosen, which will appear in the status bar of your phone.
The first notification is also be used as foreground notification to prevent Android to close this app in the background. 
So if you have any trouble with this app, I recommend to activate at least the first notification.
The second notification is an empty notification, which you can activate to have an additional icon in the status bar.

## Complications
There are several complications for the different types of wear OS complications, which provides:
* Glucose value (used also for range circle)

* Glucose value as background image (if supported by watch face and it seems to be only available in Wear OS 3)

* Delta value (per minute or per 5 minutes)

* Rate (trend) as value and arrow (the arrow rotate dynamically between +2.0 (‚Üë) and -2.0 (‚Üì) and shows double arrows from +3.0 (‚áà) and from -3.0 (‚áä))

* Battery level from wear and phone (if connected)

**IMPORTANT:** Not all complications are fully supported by any watchface. For example the SHORT_TEXT type supports an icon, a text and a title, but the most watchfaces only show icon and text or text and title, but there are some, showing all 3 types in one.
Also the RANGE_VALUE complication is handled different in each watchface.
